Unverified videos of the blasts have been posted on a variety of Telegram channels. \nThe blasts early Monday struck the airbase near the city of Engels, more than 600 kilometers inside Russian territory. The bombers damaged are said to be of the same type used to carry out airstrikes on Ukraine's infrastructure. Another explosion hit a military base near the Russian city of Ryazan. At least three people were reportedly killed after a fuel tank exploded.
